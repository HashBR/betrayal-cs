# Read-Me

This project was made to help players of the ARPG/MMORPG Path of Exile.
It's a cheat sheet for the Betrayal/Syndicate mechanic of the game. It's very editable and you can share an URL with a code so your cheat sheet can be seen by others.

## Feedback and Reporting Bugs

You can PM the author on Reddit or open an issue.

#### I didn't like the image for <Something>, can I suggest a beter one? Or the image and/or text is misleading.

Of course you can! If you want to make your own image, try to save as webp or png. And the dimensions are 80x80 pixels.
If I see that you are correct right away, I'll fix it. If not, I'd need some validation by other people that play the game as well.

### I want a cool feature!

We all want it. I've added most features I'd like in a cheat sheet, but if you have another one. Throw it to me so I can try to implement it, if applicable.

### Can you make a cheat sheet for <Insert another game here> or <Another PoE mechanic>?

I can at least try. Send me the detaisl I'll check if I have time for it.
